# MAGIC #1. History of Python:
# MAGIC **Under the leadership of “Andrew Stuart Tanenbaum” a group of employees developed Distributed Operating System. They used ABC scripting language. The ABC scripting language Is simple and easy to work. “Guido Van Rossum” is a member in that group. In the Christmas holidays, he started developing a new language to be simple and easy compared to ABC. Finally, he developed python in National Research Institute for Mathematics and Computer Science in Netherlands in 1989 and named as “PYTHON”**
